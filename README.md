# Listask

A simple task listing, tracking app with local storage

# Description:

The mobile application is a task management tool that allows users to create, organize, and complete to-do tasks. The app is designed to help users stay productive and on top of their tasks by providing an easy-to-use interface and useful features like analytics to track progress.

# Functionalities:

- **Create tasks**: The user can easily create tasks by entering a title, description, due date, and priority level for each task. The user can also assign tasks to different categories or projects to help organize their workload.

- **Complete tasks**: Once a task is completed, the user can mark it as done, and the task will be removed from their active task list. The user can also view completed tasks in a separate list to keep track of their progress.

- **Analytics**: The app provides analytics that show the user's productivity over time. The user can view graphs and charts that display the number of tasks completed each day or week, the average completion time for tasks, and other useful metrics.

- **Notifications**: The app sends push notifications to remind the user of upcoming deadlines and incomplete tasks.

- **Local storage**: The app stores all data locally on the device, which means there is no synchronization across devices.

- **Backup and restore**: The app offers the option to back up the user's task list and settings locally, so they can restore them in case of data loss or device failure.

Overall, this app is a simple yet effective tool for managing tasks and increasing productivity. Its intuitive interface and useful features make it easy for users to stay organized and on top of their workload. However, since it only stores data locally, users cannot synchronize their tasks across devices.
